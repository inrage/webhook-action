# Webhook Action

This GitHub Action sends webhook requests based on specific branches (production
or release), with options to customize verbosity and silence output. The action
generates a unique request ID, gathers relevant GitHub event information, and
sends it as a JSON payload to the configured webhook URL. The action also
supports both SHA-1 and SHA-256 HMAC signatures for securing webhook requests.

## Inputs

| Input                 | Description                            | Default   |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------|
| `production_branch`\* | Your production branch.                | `main`    |
| `release_branch`      | Your release branch.                   | `release` |
| `webhook_production`  | Webhook URL for the production.        | N/A       |
| `webhook_release`     | Webhook URL for the release.           | N/A       |
| `silent`              | Suppress the output of the action.     | N/A       |
| `verbose`             | Verbose logging of the action's steps. | N/A       |

### Note for release_branch

The `release_branch` input is optional. If you do not provide a release branch,
the action will only send webhooks to the production environment.

If the release branch matches this input, the `webhook_release` will be used.

## Outputs

| Output          | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `response-body` | The body of the response from the webhook request. |

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s an example workflow configuration using this action:

```yaml
name: Webhook Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - release

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Send Webhook to Production
        uses: your-repo/webhook-action@v1
        with:
          production_branch: 'main'
          webhook_production: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_PRODUCTION }}
          silent: false
          verbose: true

      - name: Send Webhook to Release
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/release'
        uses: your-repo/webhook-action@v1
        with:
          release_branch: 'release'
          webhook_release: ${{ secrets.WEBHOOK_RELEASE }}
          verbose: false
```

## How It Works Webhook Selection

1. The action checks whether the current branch is the production_branch or
   release_branch. If the branch is the release branch and a release webhook URL
   is provided, it sends the webhook to the release endpoint. Otherwise, it uses
   the production webhook URL. Payload:
1. The webhook payload contains information about the event (event), repository,
   commit SHA, reference, and the GitHub workflow details. A unique request ID
   (requestID) is generated for each request. Signatures:
1. The payload is signed using both SHA-1 and SHA-256 HMAC signatures, using the
   webhook URL as the secret key. Options:
1. You can control the verbosity of the logs by setting the verbose input to
   true. This will print detailed curl command logs. Setting the silent input to
   true will suppress output, but logs can still be reviewed in verbose mode.
   Response Handling:
1. The response body from the webhook request is captured and outputted under
   the response-body output. Security Ensure that sensitive information such as
   webhook_production and webhook_release URLs are stored securely in GitHub
   Secrets. Do not hardcode them in the workflow files.
